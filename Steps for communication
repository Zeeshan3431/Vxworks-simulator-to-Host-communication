step1 install wrtap driver on 32 bit wondows 

To Install the Driver on a Windows XP Host:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Double-click Add Hardware to open the Add Hardware Wizard, click Next.
3. Answer Yes, I have already connected the hardware, click Next.
4. Select Add a new hardware device (you may need to scroll down to see this
option), click Next.
5. Select Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced).
6. Click Next.
7. Select Network Adapters, click Next.
8. Click the Have Disk... button.
9. Browse to installDir\vxworks-6.x\host\x86-win32\bin (installDir is the
name of your VxWorks installation directory).
10. Select wrtap.inf and click Open.
11. Click OK to select the directory.
12. Select WindRiver WRTAP, click Next.
NOTE: If you are working on a Windows host, installing the host connection driver
(the WRTAP driver) can have an impact on your host system performance. Before
installing this driver, review the information in 5.4.1 Managing the WRTAP Driver
on Windows Hosts, p.68.

13. Click Next to start installing the driver.
14. Click Continue Anyway in the Hardware installation pop-up window.
15. Click Finish to close the wizard. 

Step 2 
in network adapter options , you will see windriver wrtap interface ,
 make its ip static to 192.168.200.254

Step 3
Now you have to make a configuration file NDC.txt and keep it at location
 C:\WindRiver-GPPVE-3.6-ARM-Eval  contents of NDC.txt are as

SUBNET_START default {
SUBNET_ADDRESS = "192.168.200.0";
SUBNET_EXTERNAL = yes;
SUBNET_EXTPROMISC = yes;
};

Step 4

Now open vxworks devlopment shell as administartor from search bar and write folloing 
command to enable wrtap driver , and to start vxworks network daemon service

C:\WindRiver-GPPVE-3.6-ARM-Eval>   vxsimnetd -f C:\WindRiver-GPPVE-3.6-ARM-Eval\NDC.txt -s

step 5
Now you have to open vxworks simulator vxsim0 from vxworks devlopment shell (as an administrator)
(Note if you open vxorks simulator from workbench and assign it ip then it doesnot work)
so for successfull communication of vxworks simulator to your PC , vxsim must be open through
vxworks devlopment shell and in vxsimo properties slect advanced boot parameters>>boot device=simnet, its command is 

to open simulator in which you have configured your project , try this in vxworks devlopment shell
to open that simulator with ping included (in this its configured with project test2)

vxsim -d simnet -e 192.168.200.1 -f C:\WindRiver-GPPVE-3.6-ARM-Eval\workspace\test2\default\vxWorks
     
 -d simnet This specifies the network device driver to use.

now you can ping vxsim from your pc 

Here i have configured vxsim0 for communication with my pc...if you want to send data from
vxworks to your PC, you have to 1st create image project, write your code there and build it
like i created test2 project here...after that i opened vxsim0 proberties >> custom simulator>>browse>>C:\WindRiver-GPPVE-3.6-ARM-Eval\workspace\test2\default\vxworks
for displaying output of test2 project in vxsim0 , open prjConfig.c file or your image project and call your function in 
that like in my case function was udpsend(), 

now when you run simulator vxsim0 from devlopment shell test2 project will automatically start running in this vxsim0
